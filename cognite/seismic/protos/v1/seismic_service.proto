/**
Service for querying data and metadata from seismic tracestore in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) seismic datastore.

Queries are done primarily on cubes, with some management endpoints for tracestores & partitions. 

Queries are divided in:
    Metadata: General information and headers for surveys and files
    Trace: Retrieve traces, be it by geometry, line or volume
    Artificial sampling: Get the (calculated/interpolated) values of properties in the file/tracestore given arbitrary positions
