/**
This is the main service for managing and querying metadata and seismic traces from Cognite Data Fusion (CDF). [`Survey`](#com.cognite.seismic.v1.survey) and [`Partition`](#com.cognite.seismic.v1.partition) objects are primarily metadata-focused, and all seismic traces are queried via references to [`SeismicStore`](#com.cognite.seismic.v1.seismicstore) or [`Seismic`](#com.cognite.seismic.v1.seismic) objects.

Queries are divided into these broad categories:
- **Management**: Creating, editing and deleting Cognite Data Fusion objects, as well as managing the status of file uploading and processing.
- **Metadata**: Information about surveys, partitions, seismic objects, and headers.
- **Trace**: Retrieving traces or information about traces.
