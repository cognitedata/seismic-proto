/**
Service for querying data and metadata from seismic cube in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) seismic datastore.

Queries are done on cubes, which represent the related traces that were originally loaded from one source.

Queries are divided in:

    - Metadata:

    General information and headers for surveys and files

    - Geometry and grid:

    Information on a file's grid and positioning, such as coverage and range of inlines and crosslines

    - Trace:

    Find a single trace in the file. A trace will include header, position information and samples.
    More details about the trace format can be found on its definition in (types.proto)

    - Vertical slice:

    Get 2D vertical slices of samples (thus 1D arrays of traces). The slices can be based on a single defined line or
    in an arbitrarily defined line with interpolation.

    - Area:

     Get 3D Cubes of samples (thus 2D arrays of traces) defined by a region in the horizontal plane

    - Horizontal slice:

     Get 2D horizontal slices of samples defined by a region in the horizontal plane and a specific index in depth/time

    - Artificial sampling:

    Get the (calculated/interpolated) values of properties in the file/cube given arbitrary positions
