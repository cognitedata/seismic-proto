/**
Service for querying data and metadata from seismic files in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) seismic datastore
We use the word `File` to refer to a single seismic file/dataset/cube. Queries on a file require it to have been
previously ingested into CDF using (ingest_service.proto)

Queries are divided in:

    - Metadata:

    General information and headers for surveys and files

    - Geometry and grid:

    Information on a file's grid and positioning, such as coverage and range of inlines and crosslines

    - Trace:

    Find a single trace in the file. A trace will include header, position information and samples.
    More details about the trace format can be found on its definition in (types.proto)

    - Vertical slice:

    Get 2D vertical slices of samples (thus 1D arrays of traces). The slices can be based on a single defined line or
    in an arbitrarily defined line with interpolation.

    - Area:

     Get 3D volumes of samples (thus 2D arrays of traces) defined by a region in the horizontal plane

    - Horizontal slice:

     Get 2D horizontal slices of samples defined by a region in the horizontal plane and a specific index in depth/time

    - Artificial sampling:

    Get the (calculated/interpolated) values of properties in the file/cube given arbitrary positions
